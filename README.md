## Social Card Maker

This was a quick project so that I can assess my foundations in React.js.  The scope of this project was to see if I can really understand data flow between parent to children and their siblings.

The initial data flow was from the child to the parent in which I made a new item for the state in parent.  The parent then passed the state as props to another child, the Social Card List, so that it can render through it's own child.  I decided to make it an array instead of just one item so that I can add more cards through time. 

I plan to add delete functionality, edit functionality, and possibly shuffle(?).
